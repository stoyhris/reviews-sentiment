## Question 1 - Results and Meaning of Word Similarity 
The majority of words similar to "good" were positive, but there were a few negative words too, such as "bad", "poor", and "terrible", as well as one neutral word: "okay". Conversely, the majority of words similar to "bad" were negative, such as "horrible" and "terrible", but there were words that were not negative, such as "good" and "funny". I believe the reason this occurs is because 300-dimensional word vectors encode lots of information. Part of the information encoded is semantic, which is why "good" is close to lots of positive words, and "bad" is close to lots of negative words. However, another part of the information encoded may be contextual. For example, words of different sentiment can be used in the same context: "this toy is good" and "this toy is terrible", which also explains why ambiguous words such as "funny" may appear close to "bad", if they appear to have been used in a negative context in the training set.
